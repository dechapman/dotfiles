.Xresources

Locations:
/user/.Xresources

Mostly machine-specific to my rxvt-unicode setup, with support for tabs,
clickable urls, and a green on black color scheme as the human eye can 
differentiate more shades in the green spectrum.

Locations:
/root/.bash_profile
/user/.bash_profile

The single line here forces the shell to use settings in .bashrc
for login shells. Do not place any other lines in .bash_profile
